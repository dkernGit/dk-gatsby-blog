In September 2019 I followed a month long challenge that Jon Acuff put on called September-January where you treat the month of September like a new beginning to the year and focus on achieving a single goal by tracking progress each day.

Along with the daily tracking you were also encouraged to recite positive affirmation before you started your day and at the end of your day. I admit I felt a little weird talking to myself in the mirror each morning or letting my kids hear me recite positive affirmations in the air. But I can say that telling yourself that you can achieve your goal or make meaningul progress does make a difference.

More than anything I think "chunking" or breaking up a longer term project into 30 minutes a day is a great way to make progress. I used that method in September to spend at least 30 minutes a day completing a Commercial Drone Pilot certification prep class on Udemy, and the other benefit to regular progress was retaining the content and feeling ready for the next steps of testing.

Now back to January of this year, I decided to do something along the lines of "100 Days of Code", but since I didn't feel proficient in coding on my own I continued to try to learn something new for at least 30 minutes per day. I started with the JavaScript section of learning on FreeCodeCamp and moved on to learn about node.js which directed me towards learning React.js. I searched a bit and found the "Zero to Mastery React Course" on Udemy. I also came across the idea of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node), so I have begun the free classes on MongoDB University.
